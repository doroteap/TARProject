# Topic 11 | Detecting Emotions from Text in Context

## Topic Description

Automatically detecting emotions from text is a very difficult problem. The main reason for this are that computational models donâ€™t have access to the vast general knowledge and experience that humans take for granted, as well as the fact that text data lacks many non-verbal queues (such as facial expression) but also verbal cues that are lost in text (such as speech intonation). In this project your task is to tackle this problem. You must build a system that, given a user utterance (as text) and two additional utterances of context, can classify the emotion of the user utterance as Happy, Sad, Angry, or Others
